# Advanced Statistics Module

## Problem Statement
Basic statistics are often insufficient to understand relationships
and distributions in real-world datasets.

## Objectives
- Measure relationships between variables
- Build predictive linear models
- Analyze data distributions
- Apply probability theory

## Features Implemented
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Linear regression (fit & predict)
- Covariance calculation
- Binomial probability functions
- Normal distribution & skewness analysis

## Outcome
This module enables deeper statistical insight and prepares data
for predictive analytics and machine learning models.
