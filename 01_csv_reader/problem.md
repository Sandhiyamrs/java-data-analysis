# CSV Reader

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating a Java program that can **read and process data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file**.  
The program should be able to:

1. Open and read a CSV file line by line.
2. Split each line into individual values (columns) using the comma `,` as a delimiter.
3. Display the data in a **tabular format** on the console.
4. (Optional) Perform simple calculations like counting rows, computing sums, or averages for numeric columns.
